      “Age is just a number” – you’ve heard of this phrase, haven’t you? But
      have you ever wondered what it means? We all have a “mental age” and
      that’s one of the reasons why we sometimes feel like an “old soul” or a
      “teen stuck in an adult’s body”. But, what is this “mental age” we all
      seem to have? <br /> <br />
      Mental age can be defined as your “mental ability expressed as the age at
      which an average person reaches the same ability”. Mental age, in
      psychological terms, is used to assess a child’s neurodevelopmental
      ability, especially in children with ASD or Down syndrome and in
      neurodevelopmental disorders where the actual age of the child does not
      always align with their mental age. <br /> <br />
      Our mental age can be calculated by observing our executive functions,
      emotional growth, and maturity. While these skills are developed as we
      age, there may be people who might not always develop these skills and
      act, feel, or behave the way they should at their age. <br /> <br />
      So, are you excited to learn your mental age? Do you think your mental age
      aligns with your actual age? Or do you believe that you’re either an old
      soul stuck in a young body or a child stuck in an adult body?
      <br /> <br />
      If you’re looking for a fun yet introspective quiz to figure out your
      mental age, then our quiz will help! Our “Mental Age Test” is designed for
      anyone who’s wondering how old they are mentally.
      <br /> <br />
      Before you begin this quiz, keep in mind that having a younger mental age
      does not mean you’re immature nor does having an older mental age mean
      you’re old-fashioned or a fuddy-duddy.
      <br />
      <br />
      A Word of Caution: This is a self-assessment test and not an official
      diagnosis. The score reflected on this quiz does not necessarily define or
      characterize your emotional, intellectual, or behavioral abilities. If
      you’re looking for an official diagnosis or assessment, it is recommended
      that you speak to a mental health professional.

      <br />
      <br />
      Your mental age is 55 and above which means you’re mentally mature. You
      have clear ideas of what you want from life and it shows. At this mental
      age, you’re looking for experiences and people you like and are quite
      close to new experiences. You’re set in your ways and OK with it. You
      prefer hanging out with your family and living a stress-free life. You
      prefer a slow pace and are very happy with it too.
