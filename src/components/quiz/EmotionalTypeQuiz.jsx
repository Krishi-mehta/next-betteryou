    One of the best powers we humans have is our emotions. Those emotions blend into us making us express our thoughts in ways we can’t always verbally explain. Learning our feelings and how they react to our situations helps us unravel our personalities and how we interact in the relationships we build. <br /> <br />
    To help you understand how emotions reframe our interactions and every relationship in our lives, here are the four emotional types that you should know about.  <br /><br />
    Don’t forget to scroll down to take our “What Is Your Emotional Type?” Quiz to help you further understand who you are, emotionally and how you can balance your emotional type.

The Rocks’ presence in your life can make others feel assured and free to express their true self without feeling or fearing judgment.

They don’t leave anyone wondering what page they are on and can quickly forgive others.
