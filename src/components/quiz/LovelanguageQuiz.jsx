      Love is a mysterious thing, isn't it? Many would describe love as a "hit-and-miss" thing, but the truth is that there's a mastery to love. I have a different definition of love, and you might have a different one. This definition can be your "language"; the language of love. Once you know how to read it, the slide of your relationship can go as smoothly as you can imagine.
      <br /><br />
      The concept of love languages was introduced by Gary Chapman in the book, "The Five Love Languages" and our love language quiz is inspired by the book. This unique love language quiz is designed to help you know your way of giving and receiving love among its five languages:
      <br /><br />
      <li>Acts of Service</li>
      <li>Receiving Gifts</li>
      <li>Quality Time</li>
      <li>Words of Affirmation, and</li>
      <li>Physical Touch</li>
      <br />
      Knowing your love language can complement your relationships with your loved ones, as this unique language can give you insights into the various expressions of love that you resonate with the most!
      <br /><br />
      So, don't wait anymore. Grab a pen and notebook, track your answers, and find your love language today. This step of self-discovery will help you figure out your primary expression of love and connect with your loved ones on an emotional level.
