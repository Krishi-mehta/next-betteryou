          As a child we are never taught the importance of Emotional well-being,
          so as a consequence we suffer. Handling emotions isn’t easy; it can
          lead to many not so good actions even in adulthood. Emotions are
          powerful, once you’re trapped, it takes a lot of time to come back and
          heal. Emotional breakdown or imbalance actually causes much more
          damage to the body and mind than a physical wound. A physical wound
          will hurt for some time and heal but emotional imbalance within won’t
          settle on its own, it will come to the surface again and again till
          the time you finally decide to eradicate it completely. Everyone on
          this planet should at least know how to live an emotionally,
          physiologically and psychologically well balanced life. It can be self
          taught. Emotional well being is keeping a check on emotions from time
          to time or giving attention to whatever that comes to the surface from
          within. If you would have asked anyone about Emotional Well-Being few
          decades ago, people would have given a strange look. Even in today’s
          time this topic is rarely discussed and is given the least importance
          anywhere you go, because for majority of the people only the outside
          world exists.

          There is absolutely no need according to them to go within and check
          on how emotionally balanced they are. It is a waste of time for people
          because time is money and it is ticking away right? All attention is
          given to all kinds of nonsense in the world but no time to just sit
          for a bit and check on yourself or someone in need. People are
          emotionally damaged and they don’t even know. They go through the
          roller coasters every now and then and tend to believe this is how it
          is supposed to be. It’s like living in a box or a cycle without even
          knowing how disturbed you are, unaware of the potential and infinite
          possibilities. The reason why this topic is rarely discussed in
          society is that nobody knows how to tackle it, the people in the
          society aren’t aware themselves of the cause and the effect. If you’d
          ask someone anything of the outside world, they can speak nonstop
          without break! On the other hand if you’d ask someone about emotional
          well-being and other aspects of life, you’d witness nothing but a
          blank face. Lack of knowledge and awareness leads to ignorance and
          ignorance is evil.

          There are numerous ways to keep in check of your emotions. Personally
          I recommend meditation. There is this false notion in the world about
          what meditation is. People think they have to focus on something
          intensely when meditating. However, meditation is just being aware of
          what’s happening inside and confronting that comes to the surface
          without judgment or attaching yourself to it. Some people check on
          themselves by maintaining a daily journal. For some, they like to talk
          with a friend or family member. Going to a therapist is a good way to
          keep a check when you feel things are slipping out of hands. Taking a
          professional help doesn’t mean you’re crazy! It simply means you’re
          fortunate enough to understand something is off inside and you’re
          working to get rid of it. NOW is always the best time to take charge
          of your emotions and understand how essential it is to live a well
          balanced life. Living a peaceful and well balanced life in all the
          aspects is the real treasure one can attain. Other than that, all
          success is nothing but a mere drama in the outside world.
