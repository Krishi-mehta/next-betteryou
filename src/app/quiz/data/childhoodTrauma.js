                Our childhood experiences shape who we are and who we become in the
                future. While some memories bring nothing but joy, others can be
                difficult to process and even traumatic. We’ve all experienced
                challenges growing up, but for some, these challenges can be
                overwhelming and leave lasting scars. <br /> <br />
                Childhood trauma refers to the experience of events that are
                frightening, dangerous, or violent, and that overwhelm a child’s
                ability to cope. These events can happen at any point during your
                childhood – from infancy to adolescence. <br /> <br />
                What kind of trauma you experience can define how your adult life will
                pan out. Some common kinds of childhood trauma you might experience
                can include; <br /> <br />
                <li>Physical, Sexual, Emotional</li>
                <li>
                  Household Dysfunction: Divorce, Separation, Domestic Violence,
                  Substance Abuse, Mental Illness
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trauma: Witnessing Violence, Accidents, or Death of a Loved One
                </li>
                <li>Neglect: Physical, Emotional, Mental</li>
                <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
                  Childhood trauma can manifest in different ways, but some common
                  symptoms of childhood trauma can include;
                </p>
                <li>Experiencing anxiety</li>
                <li>Feeling anger, fear, sadness</li>
                <li>Having low self-esteem</li>
                <li>Trouble with relationships</li>
                <li>Feeling aggressive</li>
                <li>Acting out as a child</li>
                <li>Withdrawing from social life</li>
                <li>Thinking of self-harm</li>
                <li>Using substances such as alcohol and drugs to cope</li>
                <li>Experiencing memory issues</li>
                <br />
                The impact of childhood trauma can be long-lasting. They can impact
                your physical health and increase the risk of chronic disease,
                obesity, and addiction. Adverse childhood experiences can also
                increase the risk for mental health disorders such as anxiety
                disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
                substance abuse. If you’ve experienced childhood trauma, then you
                might also find it difficult to form and maintain healthy
                relationships as an adult.

                  What Is The ACE Quiz?{" "}
                </p>
                The ACE quiz, or Adverse Childhood Experiences Quiz, is a tool used to
                assess how many childhood traumatic events you may have experienced
                (before age 18). These events can have a significant impact on your
                life and well-being. It is believed that the more your ACE score is,
                the more likely you are to have experienced childhood trauma. <br />
                <br />
                Please note that this quiz is NOT a diagnostic test, but a point for
                self-reflection. There is no right or wrong answer. Be honest with
                yourself. If the questionnaire brings up difficult memories, exit the
                quiz, and seek support. <br />
                <br />
                We also work diligently to provide you with instant results upon
                completing the test. The immediate result can help guide you to your
                next steps in seeking support and moving forward on the path of
                recovery.

              You likely had a relatively stable and supportive childhood. You may also
              have developed strong relationships with your parents, siblings, and other
              family members. You felt safe and secure growing up and were comfortable
              expressing your emotions. You most likely had positive role models who
              instilled a sense of self-worth and confidence in you.
              <br />
              <br />
              hile a no ACE score is good, it doesn’t mean that your childhood was
              perfect. A low ACE score suggests that you had a strong foundation of
              support and stability that continues to contribute to your well-being.
              <br />
              <br />
              • You value undivided attention and meaningful conversations
              <br />
              • You feel most loved when others spend focused time with you
              <br />
              • You appreciate deep discussions and shared activities
              <br />
              • You value presence over presents
              <br />
              • You cherish creating memories together
              <br />
              <br />
              Understanding this can help you communicate your needs better and
              recognize how you naturally express love to others.

              You might have experienced some challenges growing up, but they were likely not frequent or severe. Your score suggests that you had trouble in the house growing up which can put you at an increased risk of health and social concerns. You might have received support but it wasn’t always frequent and that might’ve affected your ability to believe in yourself.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can always work on regulating your emotions and building resilience. Consider seeking support from a healthcare professional or therapist who can help you develop healthy coping mechanisms.

              <br />
              A high ACE score suggests that you have experienced extensive childhood trauma or harmful events in your childhood. These events could have been physical, emotional, abusive, or neglect. Repeated exposure to childhood trauma can have an impact on your nervous system and make you more prone to chronic stress.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can cope with childhood trauma as an adult by surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people who can offer emotional encouragement. You can also put more focus on taking care of yourself by prioritizing your mental health. You can also work on developing healthy coping mechanisms such as exercising, journaling, talking to a trusted person, or seeking professional help to deal with stress and difficult emotions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Remember, a high ACE score doesn’t define you. You’re resilient so be strong. Reaching out to a therapist can help you understand the impact of your childhood trauma on your adulthood.
