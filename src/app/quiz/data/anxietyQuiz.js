            Feeling overwhelmed, worried, and uneasy has become somewhat of a common
            occurrence in our lives, despite our best efforts. Rather than allowing us
            to take a moment of reprieve, anxiety slips in and makes us worry all over
            again. If this is something that sounds familiar to you, then you’re not
            alone. To help you reclaim your peace of mind, you need to understand the
            level of anxiety you’re living with, and to help you with that, we present
            to you yet another free quiz. <br /> <br />
            Welcome to Better You’s “Do I Have Anxiety?” free anxiety test – your first
            step towards understanding your emotional and mental well-being. <br />{" "}
            <br />
            You must have had moments of unease or nervousness, as we’d like to put
            it, before anything new you try, right? This sliver of nervousness is a
            common experience, but anxiety isn’t just nervousness – it’s a relentless
            feeling that affects your everyday life. It manifests itself in physical
            health – racing heart, trembling limbs, a knot in your stomach, etc. – and
            emotionally – persistent worries, feelings of impending doom, and a hard
            time concentrating. <br /> <br />
            If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, then it’s important to
            address them. Here’s where our anxiety test comes in! Our free anxiety
            quiz is designed to help you assess your emotional state, and provide you
            with insights into your feelings that might indicate the presence of an
            anxiety disorder.
            <br /> <br />
            Know that self-awareness is the first step to bring a positive change in
            your life and this test is just one of those small steps that can set you
            on a path to recovery and healing.

            </p>
            We also work diligently to provide you with instant results upon
            completing the test. The immediate result can help guide you to your next

            <br />
            Note: Anxiety never looks the same to everybody. What you experience might
            be different from what others do, so do not compare your experiences and
            symptoms with others. This is one of the reasons why a test can’t
            conclusively provide a formal diagnosis. However, this online anxiety test
            is a questionnaire-based test that can provide you with an overview of
            your anxiety levels. <br />
            <br />
            <p style={{ fontSize: "22px", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
              Please note that this test is not an official test or diagnosis and can
              only offer an indication of your anxiety. You should seek a mental
              health professional for an in-depth diagnosis.

            Continue to practice self-care and maintain a healthy balance in your life. If you ever feel the need to reach out for help, don’t hesitate to contact a professional for support. You can also try to join anxiety support groups and online forums just to have a support resource at hand when you need it.

            Here are some tips to cope with high anxiety levels:
            <li>If your symptoms are too severe and disrupt your daily life, then you must consider seeking a professional’s help and support. A professional can help you with an evidence-based approach to treating anxiety.</li>
            <li>Add mindfulness and meditation to your daily routine. These practices can keep you grounded in the present moment and keep your mind from drifting too far.</li>
            <li>You can also practice deep breathing or conscious breathing exercises to manage shortness of breath or shallow breathing which are the most common symptoms of anxiety.</li>
            <li>Establish a daily routine with healthy meals, regular physical exercise, and an adequate sleep schedule. You can also try setting boundaries, delegating tasks, and limiting your daily stressors to avoid worsening your stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li>Practice self-compassion and be kind to yourself. Anxiety often makes you turn against yourself and self-blame. When that happens, practice compassionate self-talk and reciting positive affirmations to feel grounded in the present moment.</li>
