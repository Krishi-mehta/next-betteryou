          Oh, Sleep! How you elude me! Probably something you can relate to, right? Sleep, these days, has become the most coveted yet the most elusive thing. I mean, imagine this; as soon as you get in your best PJs – all ready to get that much-needed shuteye – and as soon as your head hits the pillow, you’re wide awake. <br /> <br />
          After counting countless sheep, reading books, and even meditating, nothing seems to work. <br /> <br />
          Could this be a sign of just a rare sleepless night or something more? <br /> <br />
          Did you know that the majority of people don’t even realize that they have a sleep disorder? And I’m not just talking about insomnia. Many types of sleep disorders can cause sleep disturbances, but in the end, all of them have one thing in common; they affect the quality of your sleep. <br /><br />
          Now, what Symptoms could Indicate a Serious Sleep Disorder?
          <br />
          Take a look at them before we move on to understand if you have a sleep issue;<br />
                <li>You fall asleep while driving</li>
                <li>
                You struggle to stay awake when inactive
                </li>
                <li>
                You have difficulty paying attention or concentrating at work, school, or home
                </li>
                <li>You have low performance at work or school</li>
                <li>You are often told by others that you look sleepy</li>
                <li>You have slowed responses</li>
                <li>You have the urge to take naps almost every day</li>
                <p>
                These symptoms are the most common ones that occur when you’re struggling with a sleep disorder. Specific disorders may have specific symptoms that you would need to speak about with a sleep specialist.
                </p>

            <br />
            Ouch! Seems like you are not getting enough sleep in the last few weeks. Sleep is an important part of our mental and emotional development and not getting a well-rested sleep can impact how you think, behave, feel, or act in your waking hours. It’s OK, though.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here’s what you can do to improve your sleep:
            <br />
            <br />
            • Go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at the same time each morning.
            <br />
            • Make sure your sleep environment is conducive to good quality rest. Your bedroom should be quiet, devoid of unnatural lighting, and has a cool temperature.
            <br />
            • Avoid eating heavy meals, drinking caffeine, and consuming alcohol before bedtime.
            <br />
            • Get some physical activity during the day. When you exercise, your muscles feel relaxed enough to fall asleep quickly at night.
            <br />

            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            So, you may not be getting the sleep you need, but it’s OK. You understand that sleep is an important part of your well-being and want to work to get the rest you desire. Your sleep hygiene may not be on par with the pros, but there is always time and many ways you can catch up to them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here’s what you can do to improve your sleep hygiene:
            <br />
            <li>Be consistent with your routine and try to get at least eight hours of sleep each night.</li>
            <li>Avoid all digital and electronic devices before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Do not think too much; just concentrate on doing something aesthetically pleasing such as reading, listening to sleep music, practicing relaxation exercises, and more..</li>
            <li>Take a warm bath or shower or try using aromatherapy oils to relax your body and mind into sleeping.</li>
