          </p><ol type="ordered">
                <li style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>The Intellectual </li>The intellectual is the emotional type who is bright and articulate and can be described as an analyst. They like to see the world in a rational light and are known to keep a cool mind in tough situations. The intellectual also struggles with emotions and intuition and is slow to open up to others and be playful.<br /><br />
                <li style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>The Empath </li>Also known as an emotional sponge, The Empaths are extremely sensitive, supportive, caring, and loving. They are finely tuned to their (as well as others’) emotions and feel everything too deeply. Sometimes, the depth of their feelings can be considered extreme and can eventually drain their emotional energy. <br /><br />
                <li style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>The Rock </li>They are the strong and silent type, dependable, and always there for you. The Rocks’ presence in your life can make others feel assured and free to express their true self without feeling or fearing judgment. However, The Rock emotional type often struggles with expressing their emotions and feelings and might have trouble connecting with others in a relationship. <br /><br />
                <li style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>The Gusher </li>The Gusher emotional type is the one who is finely attuned to their emotions and are comfortable sharing them with others. They don’t leave anyone wondering what page they are on and can quickly forgive others. One of their faults is that they tend to overshare and seem to depend a lot on external validation instead of their intuition. <br />
