          <i>"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself." — Michel de Montaigne </i>
          <br /> 
          In the pursuit of finding ourselves, we often isolate ourselves from the outside world. Sometimes, to a point, where it becomes difficult to differentiate between loneliness and solitude. Loneliness, typically concealed behind smiles and social appearances, is an emotion that can impact you and me — equally.
          <br /><br />
          It goes beyond the mere absence of others around us and transcends into the fragile connection we term — emotional connection. Watching out for signs of loneliness is a feat that requires not only inner factors of our hearts and minds but also external ones.
          <br />
          <h2>You can spot loneliness if you're;</h2>
          <li>Feeling disconnected from others</li>
          <li>Lacking meaningful connections and relationships</li>
          <li>Emotionally exhausted, drained, or numb</li>
          <li>Thinking negatively about your worthiness and self-image</li>
          <li>Struggling to maintain social connections</li>
          <li>Struggling to sleep, release stress, and keep up your appetite</li><br />
