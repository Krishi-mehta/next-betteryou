            <p className='learnmore_p1'>In a pandemic where mental health is turning from good to bad and from bad to worse, It is essential to know about coping mechanisms and understand which fits you the most. </p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>Coping Mechanisms are strategies that people use to adapt to difficult emotions and situations like stress, trauma, etc. These mechanisms help people re-adjust to unfavorable conditions and emotions while maintaining their calm and nourishing their minds.</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>  Who should have a coping mechanism? </p>
                
               <p className='learnmore_p1'> The answer is everyone. If not for you, it is essential to know about coping mechanisms if your loved one needs them.</p>
                
                <p className="par"> 1. Going for a walk or exercising </p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>One of the best coping mechanisms for good mental health is to move your body. Sinking your face into the pillow might sound like the best solution and an easier one. Still, it's essential to choose the tougher way sometimes. It can be anything- like going out for a 20-minute walk, learning the dance routine from F.R.I.E.N.D.S, doing breathing exercises, and so much more. You don't have to set up an unimaginable goal. The goal should always be to be kind to yourself. Remember that at the end of the day, you are doing it for your mental health. Moving away physically from that situation would help your mind cope with what you’re going through mentally. </p>
                
                <p className="par">2. Clean up the space you are in right now</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>Believe it or not, our surroundings have a significant impact on our mental health. One of the coping mechanisms for good mental health is to clean your surroundings. It can be anything from rearranging your cupboard (yes, including the pile of clothes on that chair) to doing your laundry or changing your bed sheet. When you keep your space clean, it helps your mind to think it is in control again.</p>

                <p className="par">3. Talk to a friend</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>  Talking to a loved one at the end of the day always makes a bad day bearable. Remember the time when they said,” Hey, you can talk to me.” They meant it. It can be tough to open up, but once you do, you will feel lighter. It's on you to talk about the situation you are facing or not. Don't forget to ask if they are in the headspace to listen and let them know you are there for them too.</p>
                
                <p className="par">4. Write/ Rant in a journal</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>Sometimes you are not in a situation where you can explain something to people. It can be because of the headspace you are in, or you can't confide in someone yet. Writing down how you're feeling helps you realize the patterns you or the people around you are putting you in. Journaling enables you to reconnect to your initial goals and values while helping you cope with your negative thoughts. You can write to yourself, your inner child, or even your future self with respect to where you are right now and what matters. Writing or journaling is a great way to maintain a relationship with yourself and, therefore, a great way to improve your mental health.</p>
                
                <p className="par">5. Listen to your favorite song or watch that episode you love</p>
                
                 <p className='learnmore_p1'>Make a playlist of all the songs you love and title it as 'My Safe Space.' Now, whenever you enter into your safe space, you will feel safe. If songs aren't your thing, do the same thing with some movies/series you love or the podcast that makes you laugh. Doing this will help you unwind the stress you are feeling while taking you to your happy place wherever it is.  </p>
                <p className="par">6. Pick up hobbies </p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>Pick up some old or new hobbies like dancing, reading, practicing makeup on yourself, painting, skincare, and so much more. The idea is not to force yourself to be perfect at it. It's allowing yourself to prioritize your own self in a non-judgemental way. When you pick up a hobby as a coping mechanism, it helps you get distracted from the tough time you are going through, and sometimes that's all you need.</p>
                
                <p className="par">7. The “5-4-3-2-1” tool to ground yourself  </p>
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>5-4-3-2-1 is a simple coping mechanism to ground yourself when you are feeling otherwise. It is as simple and helpful as it sounds.</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'> All you have to do is name-</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>-- 5 things you can see around you.</p>

                <p className='learnmore_p1'> -- 4 things you can touch around you.</p>
                  
                 <p className='learnmore_p1'>-- 3 things you can hear around you.</p>
                  
                <p className='learnmore_p1'> -- 2 things you can smell around you.</p>
                  
                <p className='learnmore_p1'> -- 1 thing you can taste.</p>
                
                <p className='learnmore_p1'>The idea is to acknowledge the things around you and make your mind and body believe that you are in a safe place with things under your control. This coping mechanism is handy when you feel anxious.</p>
                
                <p className="par">Conclusion- Find what works for you. Everyone will have different coping mechanisms. Find a therapist to help you deal with what you’re going through if you think you need help, you deserve it.</p>
